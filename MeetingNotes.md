Useful viewpoints we may need from the paper *A large-scale analysis of racial disparities in police stops across the United States*
(https://5harad.com/papers/100M-stops.pdf) David sent in the group :
- Daily black drivers were less likely to be stopped after sunset, when a ‘veil of darkness’ masks one’s race, suggesting bias in stop decisions
- By examining the rate at which stopped drivers were searched and the likelihood that searches turned up contraband, we found evidence that the bar for searching black and Hispanic drivers was lower than that for searching white drivers 
- Influence of policy 



## Apr 12, Monday
#### Step 1 (Hypothesis Testing)
Test null hypothesis: Fairness in traffic stops does not exist in Austin. Chi-square test (assumption: Each observation is independent of all the others)

#### Step 2 (Exploratory Analysis)
Obtain demographic data from US Census 2019 Austin (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/austincitytexas/LND110210)
- residential, commericial and industrial areas
- races distribution
- housing, family living arrangements
- education, health, economy, income...
GUI analysis (David)
- check if poorer areas have more traffic stops

#### Step 3 (Modeling)
- measurement of fairness (create fairness index? Search some possible existing measurements, causal inference (Cuong))
- model the distribution of the cops 
- check if cops in different races treat people in races differently

#### Step 4 (Solution)
- change some features to allviate the discrimination 
- redistribute the cops based on races

### TODO before Saturday
- Searching for/ think about the possible measurements for fairness
- Exploratory Analysis
- Seeking other usable data
