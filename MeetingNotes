#### Step 1 (Hypothesiss Test)
Test null hypothesis: Fairness in traffic stops does not exist in Austin. Chi-square test (assumption: Each observation is independent of all the others)

#### Step 2 (Exploratory Analysis)
Obtain demographic data from US Census 2019 Austin (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/austincitytexas/LND110210)
- residential, commericial and industrial areas
- races distribution
- housing, family living arrangements
- education, health, economy, income...
GUI analysis (David)
- check if poorer areas have more traffic stops

#### Step 3 (Modeling)
- measurement of fairness (create fairness index? Search some possible existing measurements, causal inference (Cuong))
- model the distribution of the cops 
- check if cops in different races treat people in races differently

#### Step 4 (Solution)
- change some features to allviate the discrimination 
- redistribute the cops based on races

TODO before Saturday:
- Searching for/ think about the possible measurements for fairness
- Exploratory Analysis
- Seeking other usable data
